# NBA Database stats

Welcome! 

The purpose of repository is to build a personal NBA database.

My goal is to gather data so that I can perform meaningful analysis to help better understand the NBA. The code involved up to this point has not been written by me, but I have had to update the code to tailor my needs. This is an ongoing project for myself and I plan on maintaining and updating as time permits.

I plan to use Python to scrape the data into CSV files, SQL as a database to clean/maintain, and Power BI/Tableau for visualizations. I am also interested in developing machine learning models with the data and running regression analytics through python.

I understand that there are many different ways to approach this goal, which may seem very overwhelming for a beginner that is interested in NBA analytics; therefore, the methods I have used made the most sense to me at the time of development during my education. 

Sportsdata.io also has NBA APIs that I have used in SQL servers, this requires importing JSON files.
