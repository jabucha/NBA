# NBA Database stats

Welcome! If you haven't noticed by now, I love :basketball:

The purpose of repository is to build a personal NBA database.

I plan to use Python to scrape the data into CSV files, SQL as a database to clean/maintain, and Power BI/Tableau for visualizations

My goal is to gather as much data as possible so that I can perform meaningful analysis to help better understand the inner workings of the NBA. As we all should be aware by now, the NBA has been transitioning into a more analitically based sport and in order to keep up with the times, creating a database will allow those interested to perform their own statistical analysis. 

The code involved up to this point has not been written by me, but I have had to update the code to tailor my needs.

I have tried my best to give credit where credit is due, and will continue to do so. 

This is an ongoing project for myself and I plan on maintaining and updating as time permits.

I have spent countless hours surfing the web for ways to scrape/maintain/update NBA data and consequently it has led to many dead ends, but my hope is that every deadend leads to better knowledge and finding the correct insights down the road.

I understand that there are many different ways to approach this goal, which may seem very overwhelming for a beginner that is interested in NBA analytics; therefore, the methods I have used made the most sense to me at the time of development during my education.
